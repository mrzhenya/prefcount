ICON FOR MAC OS
==============================================================
Mac OS free developers tools include IconComposer utility, which
can be used to create .icns icon files. Just install the tools and
run IconComposer (located in /Developer/Application/) - this is
a GUI tool which supports drag-and-drop.


ICON FOR LINUX
==============================================================
We can use .png file for an icon on Linux.


ICON FOR WINDOWS
==============================================================
I use the png2ico utility, which can generate the .ico file.
Check out it from <http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/>
and run it with the png files (1 - many) on the command line:

    png2ico PrefCount-16x16.png PrefCount-32x32.png

... more files can be added to generate an icon file that
supports multiple resolutions.

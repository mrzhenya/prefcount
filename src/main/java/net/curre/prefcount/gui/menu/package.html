<h3>Package net.curre.prefcount.gui.menu Description</h3>

<p>
  Contains GUI menu bar classes. Code in this package is responsible
  for creating platform dependent menu bars. It is important to
  note that we need to create platform specific menu bars because
  Substance LAF library does not fully support Mac OS native menu
  bars (the one at the top of the screen). In particular, we can't
  place a swing menu bar at the top of the screen on Mac OS when
  using Substance LAF - only an awt menu bar can be placed there on
  Mac OS.

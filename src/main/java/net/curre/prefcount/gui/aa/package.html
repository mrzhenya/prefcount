<h3>Package net.curre.prefcount.gui.aa Description</h3>

<p>
  Contains base GUI component classes that add font anti-aliasing, which makes
  the text in these components look smoother and appealing to the eye. Every class
  in this package extends one of the swing component classes and overrides its
  <code>paint(Graphics g)</code> method. The "intercepted" graphics context is
  used to enable font anti-aliasing and passed to the <code>super.paint(Graphics g)</code>
  method. No other functionality should be added to components in this package.

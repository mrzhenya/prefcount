PACKAGING FOR WINDOWS
==============================================================
To create an executable for Windows, we use utilityJexePack:
<http://www.duckware.com/jexepack/>. Note that you can use
this utility for free, but every time you run the packaged exe
file, you will get a "please register" note (ones per run).
When you get annoyed enough, you can either purchase a license
(runs about $100, unfortunately) or email me and I can do
the packaging myself.

Another tool is JExeCreator. It's a GUI tool and it's cheaper
($75) - <http://www.ucware.com/jexec>, but there is no command
line functionality.


HOW TO GENERATE AN EXE FILE USING JEXEPACK
==============================================================
Put the configuration file (prefcount.ini), the windows icon
file (PrefCount.ico), and the executable jar file into the
same directory, navigate there and execute the jexepack command
with the configuration file argument on the command line:

    jexepack @prefcount.ini

This will create an executable PrefCount.exe which you can run,
assuming the jre version > 1.5 is installed on your system.

Make sure names of the packaged files match the ones in the
configuration file. You can also modify other configuration
settings in the ini file - for full list of options, please, see
the JexePack website.

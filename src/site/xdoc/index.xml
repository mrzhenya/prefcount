      <p>
        PrefCount is an application that assists with counting up
        the results of a game of Preferance (also Preference, or Preferans).
        If you don't play Preferance, this application will do no good for you.
        By the way, Preferance is an old card game that originated in
        Russia in the middle of the XIX century and is still
        widely played across Central Europe and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
        PrefCount is written in Java 1.5 and runs perfectly on multiple
        platforms: Windows

        <img src="images/icon_mac.gif" alt="Mac logo" />, and Linux
        <img src="images/icon_linux.gif" alt="Linux logo" />.
